There has been a growing and spreading interest in blockchain technology and its implementations over the past few years. One such application is the ability to make anonymous and secure digital payments. This has prompted agencies all over the world to look into a kind of “central bank money” with which to make these payments. This money is also known as Central Bank Digital Currency (CDBC). 

Apart from the usual security, reliability and verifiability of the transactions when connected to the internet, it is also important to develop an “offline” capability in which users need not be connected to the internet to make transactions. This creates a system in which users can exchange money in any scenario and place. Hence, the Offline Payment System (OPS) protocol is proposed to grant such a facility.

**We implemented the Registration and Transaction protocols through an Android app whose purpose was to provide an offline payment functionality which allowed users to make transactions even in the absence of the internet, by connecting to a local hotspot.**
