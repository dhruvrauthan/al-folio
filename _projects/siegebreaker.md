[Original SiegeBreaker](https://petsymposium.org/2020/files/papers/issue3/popets-2020-0051.pdf)

We are developing a performance and privacy improvement over the original SiegeBreaker concept. The design involves a SmartNIC instance which identifies a covert flow and redirects it to a docker container that establishes custom TLS tunnels. Using our design, a client can circumvent firewalls to connect to blacklisted websites. We are currently working on its practical implementation.
